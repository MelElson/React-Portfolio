      I am originally from the East Coast and moved out to Denver to be closer to my family. I currently work as
          a Service Desk Professional for the University of Colorado. I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer
          Science. I'm currently attending the University of Denver Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp. Highlited are several projects I have
          worked on during the bootcamp as a few examples of my work with coding. Aside from work, I am an avid
          photographer and enjoy taking landscape
          and street photography. I also love hiking with my dogs and spending time with my nieces and nephew.
